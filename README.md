# Integer Overflow in Factorial Function

This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates an integer overflow bug in a factorial function. The factorial function is implemented recursively. When the input is large enough, the factorial will exceed the maximum value of an integer, causing an integer overflow. This will result in incorrect results.

The solution demonstrates how to address integer overflow issue.
